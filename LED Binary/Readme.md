# Readme
## Description 
This is an arduino project that takes a decimal number from the Serial monitor and converts it to binary and shows the binary representation in an array of 5 led's<br/>
Since there are only 5 leds the range of numbers that can be represented are 0-31<br/>
## Code
How this code works is that we can input any number in the serial monitor between 0 to 31 but if you enter 1024 it starts a sequence of displaying numbers from 1 to 31
<br/>
